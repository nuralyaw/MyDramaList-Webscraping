# MyDramaList-Webscraping
This repository contains the code for a web scraping project that was utilised in my [K-Drama-Recommendation-System](https://github.com/nuralyaw/K-Drama-Recommendation-System) repository. It is dedicated to extracting data from the website MyDramaList. Instead of performing a single, lengthy web scraping operation, the script is organised to create subdatasets from different web pages and saved into separate csv files, which can be merged later.

## Acknowledgments
The website used to webscrape from was [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/).
